Refactor code and add it together

implement new languages and better test systems

get better hardware testing bed eg the i2c connection one that checked all device addresses

implement config system so that YU doesnt change device code directly just updates adresses and stuff

else integrate scanning code with the temperature code so that it scans then uses the first available adress

only do this if there is computational space available

improve error messages to include troubleshooting hints eg: No i2c devices detected. Is the temperature sensor connected properly?

put in check that makes sure that the raw bytes arent all 255


even better yet rewrite code using TDD for extra robustness and improve text editor ie move to vim + ino
